# INTROSPECTION


## Why we must choose you?

I had cse in my 11th and 12th standard and once i started coding i knew that i wanted to pursue my career in this field.I feel the biggest reason to choose me is,me being very independent and willingness to participate in many stuff.I have still a lot of things to learn and i feel amfoss will guide me through my entire journey.Even if i dont get into amfoss this year i am sure to work hard and get into this club the next year.

## What is my plan in the next 6 months?

I want to explore more fields and find my exact passion.I didnt concenterate much on cse in my 11th and 12th std because i was fully concenterating on JEE but now as those core subjects are out of the way,i can start concenterating on the subjects that i like the most.So, i will spend a lot of time in improving my skills and learn whatever i could about android developement,web developement, open source etc.

## How would you contribute back to this club?

I would love to contribute in whatever way possible.I will try to meet the demands of the club and work really hard to represent the club.

## Do you have any feedback for the selection process?

Its my humble request to not include more than one language to do the task because i wasted a lot of time learning java and c language but still was unable to do the task.Please dont take it in a negative way.Other tasks were very good in my opinion.
