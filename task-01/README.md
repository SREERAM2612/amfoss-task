# Star all amfoss repositories

I went through the link given in the amfoss repo.There was a java script star.user.js that my laptop was not allowing me to download.S o as an alternative i searched a lot and got a similar java script and used that https://github.com/fossasia/star-me/blob/master/star.user.js .
